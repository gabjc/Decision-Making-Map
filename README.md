# Decision Making Map


Project Name: Decision Making Map

Project Description:
Location-based collaborative decision making app. User will be able to input a location, distance from that location, and what they are looking for (restaurant, entertainment, etc.). The app will then display a link/QR code/code to give others so they can collaboratively decide where they want to go and where they do not want to go in real-time. Users will be able to decline places they do not want to go so it makes it easier to visualize their current choices.

Current possible functionality:
-Accounts that will keep track of decision maps that they were invited to, or they created.
-Users can click on tabs to seamlessly switch to other decision maps.
